# Common Ways to Organize Multistate Regression Data with Censoring

Censoring occurs when the complete information about a subject's state transitions is not fully observed. Here are the main ways multistate regression data is organized with censoring information included:

## 1. Person-Period Format with Censoring
```
ID  Time  State  Censored  Covariate1  Covariate2
1   1     A      0         25          Female
1   2     B      0         25          Female
1   3     B      1         25          Female
2   1     A      0         42          Male
2   2     A      1         42          Male
```
*Censored=1 indicates observation ended while in this state*

## 2. Transition Format with Censoring
```
ID  FromState  ToState  StartTime  EndTime  Duration  Censored  Covariate1
1   A          B        1          2        1         0         25
1   B          B+       2          3        1         1         25
2   A          A+       1          2        1         1         42
```
*"+" suffix or special code indicates right-censoring in final state*

## 3. Long Format with Censoring Indicator
```
ID  Time  StateA  StateB  StateC  Censored  Covariate1
1   1     1       0       0       0         25
1   2     0       1       0       0         25
1   3     0       1       0       1         25
2   1     1       0       0       0         42
2   2     1       0       0       1         42
```

## 4. Wide Format with Censoring
```
ID  State_T1  State_T2  State_T3  CensorTime  CensorState  Covariate1
1   A         B         B         3           B            25
2   A         A         NA        2           A            42
```
*NA indicates unobserved due to censoring*

## 5. Counting Process Format with Censoring
```
ID  FromState  ToState  Count  Exposure  Censored  Covariate1
1   A          B        1      1         0         25
1   B          C        0      1         1         25
2   A          B        0      2         1         42
2   A          C        0      2         1         42
```

## 6. Interval Censoring Format
```
ID  LeftTime  RightTime  LeftState  RightState  Covariate1
1   1         2          A          B           25
1   2         3          B          B           25
2   1         2          A          A           42
2   2         4          A          ?           42
```
*? indicates unknown state at right time due to censoring*

## 7. Event History Format with Censoring Types
```
ID  Time  Event  EventType  CensorType  Covariate1
1   2     1      Aâ†’B        0           25
1   3     0      NA         1           25
2   2     0      NA         2           42
```
*CensorType: 0=observed, 1=right-censored, 2=interval-censored*
